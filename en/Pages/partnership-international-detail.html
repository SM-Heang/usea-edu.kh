	<strong>BACKGROUND </strong>
</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content; ">
	UBRU is a state-run university under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Commission on Higher Education, Ministry of Education.&nbsp; The University was established at its present location in 1942 as a pre-university school of the Northeast, affiliated with Chulalongkorn University and then converted to a Teacher Training School in 1947, offering a primary certificate and a provincial certificate in teaching.&nbsp; In 1955, a certificate of education was offered.&nbsp; Students were admitted from various provinces, namely, Ubon Ratchathani, Sri Sa ket, Surin, Sakon Nakhon, and Nakhon Phanom.&nbsp; In 1968, it was elevated to be Ubon Teachers&rsquo; College where a Higher Certificate of Education, an Associate Degree in Education, was offered.&nbsp; It was not until 1973 that a degree program in education majoring in biology was first offered.&nbsp; Other majors were then offered to match the preparation of relevant departments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
	In 1984, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the teachers&rsquo; colleges function as community colleges, offering vocational programs in order to serve the community demand.&nbsp; Due to the change in the functions, the name Rajabhat Institute was graciously granted by the King to all teachers&rsquo; colleges in 1992.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s crest was also granted to Rajabhat Institutes for their symbols.&nbsp; It can be seen that the University has had a long history, starting from specifically providing teacher education and extensively expanding into other areas of study commensurate to the need of the society and the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
	Accordingly a strategic plan has been set to provide educational opportunity with focus on the development of locality, the quality of graduates, community empowerment, the standard of higher education to build competitive potential, and other aspects including searching for cooperation and expanding educational network with universities both inside and outside the country, especially in the GMS countries and in other regions with mutual interest and benefit. Based on the Rajabhat University Act 2004, UBRU is a comprehensive university effective 15 June, 2004.&nbsp; It is operating its degree programs through nine faculties, two colleges, one graduate school and several other support units.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
	Since the University has been expeditious in many aspects of development to serve future progress, it therefore established a new educational service campus, 30 km from the main campus of Mueng District.&nbsp; The newly established campus is situated in Yang Noi Village, Kor Ei Sub-district in Khueng Nai District of Ubon Ratchathani Province, on a 1,027 rais plot of land.&nbsp; By extending service this way, the University has carried out many important projects as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
	Organizing an agricultural form project on the occasion of celebrating the 50<sup>th</sup> birth anniversary of HRH.&nbsp; Prince Vajiralongkorn, as demonstrated in various models of agricultural farms such as rubber-tree plantation, orchards, poultry and hog farms, and integrated dairy farms (raising dairy cows and building a milk-processing factory).&nbsp; Establishing a model learning center based on self-sufficient economy philosophy.&nbsp; Conserving Mekhong-aquatic-plant species.&nbsp; Founding a training center and an academic service building for the local community.</p>

	<strong>University of Malaya</strong>, or <strong>UM</strong>, Malaysia&#39;s oldest university, is situated on a 750 acre (309 hectare) campus in the southwest of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. It was established in April 1949 in Singapore with the merger of the King Edward VII College of Medicine (founded in 1905) and Raffles College (founded in 1928).<br>
	<strong>The University of Malaya</strong> derives its name from the term &#39;Malaya&#39; as the country was then known. The Carr-Saunders Commission, which recommended the setting up of the university, noted in its Report in 1948: &quot;The University of Malaya would provide for the first time a common centre where varieties of race, religion and economic interest could mingle in joint endeavour ... For a University of Malaya must inevitably realise that it is a university for Malaya.&quot;<br>
	The growth of the University was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and this resulted in the setting up of two autonomous Divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur. In 1960, the government of the two territories indicated their desire to change the status of the Divisions into that of a national university. Legislation was passed in 1961 and the University of Malaya was established on 1st January 1962.<br>
	On June 16th 1962, University of Malaya celebrated the installation of its first Chancellor, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, who was also the country&#39;s first prime minister. The first Vice-Chancellor was Professor Oppenheim, a world-renowned Mathematician.<br>
	Currently, His Royal Highness The Sultan of Perak Darul Ridzuan is the Chancellor of the University of Malaya.<br>
	Ghauth Jasmon was appointed as the tenth Vice-Chancellor of University of Malaya on 8th November 2008.

	The <strong>University of the West of England</strong> (also known as <strong>UWE Bristol</strong>, or simply <strong>UWE</strong>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University" title="University">university</a> located near the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Its main campus is at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchay,_Bristol" title="Frenchay, Bristol">Frenchay</a> near Bristol, about five miles (8&nbsp;km) north of the city centre and close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M32_motorway" title="M32 motorway">M32 motorway</a><br>
	UWE also has campuses at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenside,_Bristol" title="Glenside, Bristol">Glenside</a> in north-east Bristol and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bower_Ashton" title="Bower Ashton">Bower Ashton</a>, near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton_Court" title="Ashton Court">Ashton Court</a> in south-west Bristol.

	The University of the West of England can trace its roots back to the foundation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Venturers" title="Merchant Venturers">Merchant Venturers</a> Navigation School, which was founded in 1595. Part of this institution, to which the Universities of Bristol and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bath" title="University of Bath">Bath</a> also partly owe their origins, became a technical college which, after merger with other colleges, in turn became <em>Bristol Polytechnic in 1970; the then-main campus was at Ashley Down, now a campus of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Bristol_College" title="City of Bristol College">City of Bristol College</a>. Like the other former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytechnic_%28United_Kingdom%29" title="Polytechnic (United Kingdom)">polytechnics</a>, this gained university status and its present name as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_and_Higher_Education_Act,_1992" title="Further and Higher Education Act, 1992">Further and Higher Education Act, 1992</a>.<br>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Matthias,_Bristol" title="St Matthias, Bristol">St Matthias</a> site (which is no longer owned by the university) was originally built in Victorian times and was a teacher training college. These campuses, together with campuses in Redland, Ashley Down, Unity Street and Frenchay became part of Bristol Polytechnic around 1976.<br>
	The Avon and Gloucestershire College of Health which is now the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenside,_Bristol" title="Glenside, Bristol">Glenside</a> Campus and the Bath and Swindon College of Health Studies joined in January 1996.

	<img align="left" alt="batu_asas_history" height="169" hspace="12" src="../../media/Partnership/mara-img.jpg" width="400" height="600" />RIDA (Rural &amp; Industrial Development Authority) Training Centre was the inspiration of Dato' Onn Ja'afar, the founder and former president of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). The idea was conceived as a result of a study visit to Ceylon in 1951 (now Sri Lanka) to look into its rural development programme in 1951. A resulting working paper outlined the establishment of RIDA (Rural and Industrial Development Authority) and its objectives of rebuilding the rural society, as well as improving rural the community's economy.There were two centres under the auspices of&nbsp; RIDA : Taman Asuhan RIDA (Kuala Lumpur) and Dewan Latehan RIDA (Petaling Jaya). Dewan Latehan RIDA began operations in November 1956 under its first principal, Tuan Syed Alwi bin Syed Sheikh Alhadi. It was officially opened by Dr Ismail bin Dato' Abdul Rahman, the Minister for Trade and Industry on 14 February 1957.Dewan Latehan RIDA conducted several external professional courses offered by established international bodies, such as the London Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Chartered Secretaryship, the Australian Society of Accountants and the British Institute of Management.In 1964, Dewan Latehan RIDA held its first convocation and 50 graduates were awarded certificates by Tun Abdul Razak, the then Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size:1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
	Dewan Latehan RIDA became known as Maktab MARA or MARA College, in June 1965.The name change also meant that the college no longer operated under RIDA, instead became the most important unit of the MARA Training Division.MARA, which stands for &quot;Majlis Amanah Rakyat&quot; or the Council of Trust for the Indigenous People took over and strengthened the role and responsibilities of RIDA. In 1966, when the British Institute of Management ceased conducting external examinations, MARA College began running its own Diploma in Business Studies. International recognition for the course came from Ealing Technical College of London, which also became its external examiner. This linkage with an internationally established institution proved to be the first of many future linkages, a tradition that started in 1956 with Dewan Latehan RIDA, and still continues until today in UiTM.</p>


<h2 style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
	<strong>MARA Institute Of Technology 1967 - 1999</strong>
</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size:1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
	MARA College was officially renamed Institut Teknologi MARA on 14 October 1967. Its establishment came as a response to a crucial need in the country for trained manpower at professional and semi-professional levels, especially among bumiputeras. This shortage was identified through a manpower survey conducted by the government in 1965 collaboration with the United Nations.
	<br/>
	ITM's rapid development during those years had come about with the expansion of its educational programmes, which were in line with the requirements of an increasingly demanding job market. Many courses were internationally affiliated and the institute offered advanced diploma courses, which were the equivalent to general degrees.
	<br/>
	ITM's development is best seen from three phases that spanned a period of 32 years. The first phase (1967-1976) came with the declaration of the institute as an autonomous body with its own 300-acre campus in Shah Alam, and was placed under the Ministry of Rural Development.
	<br/>The second phase (1976-1996) saw ITM rapidly harnessing its potential as an institution of higher learning. It led to the passing of the ITM Act of 1976 that placed the institute directly under the Ministry of Education.
	<br/>
	The third phase (1996-1999) came about as a result of an amendment to the 1976 Act which put ITM on par with all the universities&nbsp; in the country. For functional purposes, ITM was granted all the powers of a university. But its historical name was retained until August 26, 1999. The main areas of change are as follows:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:30px;">
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size:1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		The governing body of ITM, the Council, was converted into the Board of Directors with a larger private sector&nbsp; representation than before;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size:1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		The Board of Directors was given the power to enact on behalf of the Institute;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		A Senate was created;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		Many principal officers of ITM were re-designated. The Director was renamed Rector, the Head of Campus became the Provost, while Principal and Senior Lecturers were re-designated as Professors and Associate Professors, repectively;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		Each School was redesignated as a Faculty;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		ITM was given the power to confer degrees up to Ph.D' level;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		ITM was given the unique power to establish courses and campuses abroad with permission from the Minister of Education;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		The Institute was conferred additional powers to enable it to conduct business, invest in shares, set up companies and engage in commercial research;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">

	<li style="text-align: justify; color: #002060; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: Khmer OS Content;">
		In August 1999, the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, YAB Dato' Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad announced the change in name of ITM to Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). With such acknowledgement from the government, a major restructuring exercise was carried out in order to consolidate the University's resources for optimum productivity.UiTM aspires to be world class in all its endeavours and forges ahead in a direction that is in tandem with the latest developments in the world. As UiTM moves forward, it remains focused on academic excellence, innovation, socio-economic goals, worldwide accreditation, globalisation and new technologies in order to contribute to industry and national development.</li>
